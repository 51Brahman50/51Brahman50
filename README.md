# ***Brahman Cyber Security***
--------------------------------

Brahman, in Hindu philosophy, is often described as the ultimate reality or universal consciousness. It is considered the unchanging, infinite, and supreme reality from which everything emanates. Some interpretations suggest that Atman (individual self) and Brahman (universal consciousness) are ultimately the same, and the goal of spiritual enlightenment is to recognize this unity.
